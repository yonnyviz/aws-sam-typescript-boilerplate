// If this is to be invoked directly, we can create our own event
export interface Event {
  name: string;
}

// Or if it were to be called via APIGateway or S3, we could specify those events specifically:
// type Event = AWSLambda.APIGatewayEvent | AWSLambda.S3Event;

// This example demonstrates a NodeJS 8.10 async handler[1], however of course you could use
// the more traditional callback-style handler.

export default async (event: any): Promise<any> => (
  event.name
  // `Hello ${event.name}`
);
